Mule JasperReports Connector
============================

JasperReports is an open source reporting tool that can generate outputs in a variety of formats (Word, PDF, HTML, Excel). 
http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library

An ESB can be the central information hub of an enterprise - information flows through it most commonly as XML or JSon documents. 
In addition to integrating source and target systems, information often needs to be printed 
or stored in different formats - this is what JasperReports allows us to do. 

With this connector, with some setup, the data from the ESB can be sent to the reports engine and the connector returns a formatted document
that can be printed/emailed or simply presented to end users for download.
