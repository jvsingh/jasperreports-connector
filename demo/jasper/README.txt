Sample 1: Example based on XML data
=========
Jasper source file (jrxml) 
and the compiled .jasper file that is referenced inside the demo flow. 
(see mule-app.properties)

The file testReportXMLInputSample.xml contains sample data for the testReport
(the mule flow needs to create this)

Sample 2: Example based on JSon data
========
An invoice sample
The associated mule flow creates the JSon payload matching sampleInvoice.json and passes it on to the connector.
